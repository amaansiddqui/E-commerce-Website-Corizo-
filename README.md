# E-commerce Dashboard Wireframes

This package contains static HTML wireframes for an **E-commerce** project as per the reference PDF modules.

## Files

- `index.html` – entry page with links to both dashboards.
- `user-dashboard.html` – User dashboard wireframe (products grid, filters, cart, orders links).
- `admin-dashboard.html` – Admin dashboard wireframe (KPI cards, orders table, customers table).

## How to Use

Just open any `.html` file in a browser. Tailwind CSS is loaded via CDN; no build step required.

## Notes

These are wireframes (structure-only). Replace placeholders with real data and hook up to your backend as needed.
